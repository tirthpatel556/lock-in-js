1. what i understood
variables,loops,condition,function.

let name="Tirth";
let age=19;
let isStudent=true;
console.log(name,age,isStudent);
console.log(typeof(name,age,isStudent)); 
//by using comma js reads it as comma operator and return the last value so it ignores name and age hence the answer is boolean cause last one is isStudent
console.log(typeof(5+"5")); // + in js cosidered as string other -*/ are number.

2.what confused me:
even and odd question

let number=4;
if (number%2===0){   //=== is compulsory cause its strictly comparative    console.log("even"); //little confusion but easy
}
else{
    console.log("odd");
}

3.what felt easy: mostly everything because everything was same as c.

4.what felt hard: === (not that hard though.
